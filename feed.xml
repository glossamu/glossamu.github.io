<p class="align-right"><span style="color: #ced4d9;">The Taste of Ethnographic Things. The Senses in Anthropology (1989) </span></p>
<p>I wish I had started this page with the words of a person I could identify with more. <br>Also, I never liked identifying as an anthropologist. <br>However, since I have been a student of that field for many years, I cannot escape from the fact that this science has shaped me and that I have learned to embrace the methods of this very discipline of stepping back and listening to people's cultures, people's stories without the attempt to judge. Listening with a flashlight in my hand that enlarges the speaker's space and visibility. I am qualified for the anthropological mission of enhancing, creating, enlarging and securing marginalized spaces. This mission is what I like. </p>
<p>When I read the words from the quote above for the first time, I was touched. Not because I knew Paul Stoller or any of his work or background but because they pinpoint the responsibility I have given myself for this very final thesis: It simply has to make sense to me. <br>Therefore, I had to choose a topic that tickles my senses, pulls on them and pushes them to feel. It was the emotional connection that I had been longing for and that I have learned to shape with these words, my work. I might have lost my hope to our institute, to its leaders and to some of the upcoming anthropologists it produces, but I have not lost my senses. I have never lost my feelings which is why I finally finished writing about this song today.</p>
<p>A child needs nine months until it feels fresh air on its wet skin, until it feels air running through its entire body for the first time. And so, did my work need time to grow until it got ready to inhale and to exhale all the feelings that we have gone and grown through. </p>
<p>Here comes a portray of our world. </p>
